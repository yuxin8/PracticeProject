Practice Project:

This website shows a list of the items I want to give away or sell. 

On the heading navigation bar, it has two tabs: welcome page and product list page.

If you click any item on product list page, it will get to the item detail page. On detail page, the Back button will bring this webpage back to product list page. This uses the routing technic. 

I added a filter function to filter items by typing something in a text block. It uses Getters and Setters, and Arrow Functions to filter out. Itâ€™s not case sensitive. 

Another function is that it has a show/hide image button to show/hide images on the page which uses data binding.

Also, did some format to the price number, and styled some text.
